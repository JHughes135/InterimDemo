Games Engines 1 Assignment Proposal

For my Games Engines assignment I plan on procedurally generating a city containing a reasonable variation of buildings, streets and potentially other objects that might be found in a city. 

My reason for this is, for my Final Year Project I am creating a game/simulation with Unity to determine how well a rule-based approach to implementing Isaac Asimovâ€™s three laws of robotics works for self-driving cars. For this I will need to generate streets for the cars to drive on. I also like the idea of created random environments to explore.

I have done some research into what is needed to achieve this and have looked at other similar projects for inspiration.
